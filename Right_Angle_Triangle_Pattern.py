'''
Given an integer n. Write a program to print the Right angle triangle wall. The length of perpendicular and base is s. 
Note: Print exactly single " " after "*". Print a new line after printing the triangle.

Example:

Input: n = 4
Output:
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
Explanation: Length of perpendicular and base of triangle is 4 .
Input: n = 3
Output:
* 
* * 
* * * 
Explanation: Length of perpendicular and base of triangle is 3 .

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 20
